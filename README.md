Problem Statement: 
1. Smart Governance & Civic Engagement:
In today's rapidly evolving world, The gap between citizens and governments is growing, leading to low trust and civic participation. This disconnect leads to reduced trust inpublic institutions and lower participation in civic activities. Government services often lack transparency, making it difficult for citizens to access essential resources or frack the progress of public projects. Voter engagement remains a challenge due to outdated outreach and distrust in electoral systems. Addressing these issues is critical to fostering a more inclusive, transparent, and participatory democracy.

The solution website is a feedback based form, where the feedback and name given by the general public is then visible to the government, thus increasing transparency, and also helps the govt. know the demands of the public. 

This website uses both frontend and backend(to store the feedback and display it).
